This is a fork of [Reset card(s) scheduling information / progress](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1432861881) with support for Anki 2.1 and other smaller tweaks. All credits for the original add-on go to Jeff Baitis. Thanks also to [Dmitry Mikheev](https://github.com/ankitest) for his helpful patches to the original code.

**ORIGINAL DESCRIPTION**

*Ever imported someone else's deck that contained scheduling information associated with cards?* It's really annoying. Until now, the only way to fix the problem was to re-export the deck and un-check the "Include Scheduling Information" checkbox.

Well, no more! Install this add-on, go into the *card browser* (click the "Browse" option from the main deck browser). *Select* some cards (maybe with Control-A?), and choose the Edit menu option: *"Reset scheduling and learning on selected cards."* If you don't like the changes, you can always Edit -> Undo (Control-Z) afterward.

This add-on also *allows you delete your own scheduling information*. I acknowledge that this usage case breaks the spatial repetition concept and goes against the spirit of Anki. If you do this, you risk having uncomfortable dreams, and all flowers within a ten-meter radius of your position might suddenly and spontaneously wilt.

**NEW FEATURES IN THIS VERSION**

- Anki 2.1 compatibility
- Ability to reset decks right from the deck screen (2.1 exclusive)
- Ability to reset cards by right-clicking on them in the browser (2.1 exclusive)
- More checks and safeguards
- Improved handling of filtered decks (thanks to Dmitry Mikheev)

**COMPATIBILITY**

This add-on is designed to work both on Anki 2.0 and Anki 2.1. However, as Anki 2.1 is still being tested it is possible that a future beta release will break 2.1 compatibility. **Please do not report issues with Anki 2.1 in the review section below**. Instead, please report all issues you encounter on [GitHub](https://github.com/glutanimate/reset-card-scheduling/issues).

2018-07-25: **v1.1.0** – Initial release of this updated fork
2015-06-18: **v1.0.0** – Original release for Anki 2.0
